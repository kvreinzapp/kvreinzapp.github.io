- "Gets easier, you don't it will, but it does."
- "But the reality is we don't know what went wrong anymore than what we went right. What we do know is as the chemical window closedanother awakening took place."
- "That the human spririt is more powerful than any drug. And that is what needs to be nourished with work, play, friendship, family.These are the things that matter. This is what we had forgotten. The simplest things."

- 淡淡的电影，所有人都是天使一样的好人。没有反转和诡计，没有激烈的冲突，或许因为疾病本身便是不可承受的苦痛。It is gived and taken, just like everyone's life, only the difference is that life is longer than a single summer of 1969, which makes most of us do not trasure it. *Time of the season* 很好听。
- 在leonard刻下一行字后，再醒来便是30年，电影中很多的苦痛被简单的句子一笔带过。即便是代入一点病人的视角，便会觉得无法喘息。庆幸自己没病的同时想象如果是自己经历这些会是怎样的不可承受。但经历不可承受的痛苦是人生的必经之路，害怕也没用。
- 就像结尾说的，我们忽视了最简单却最重要的东西。但没有失去又体会不到重要，没有永恒的极乐，快乐是自己赋予的意义。但这一切在疾病面前又如此脆弱。
