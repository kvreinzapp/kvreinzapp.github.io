- I am tired of list all this list stuff, cause i never make it, but after watching the lecture "the last lecture", (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo). I decide to write one more.
- 10 push up
- Better clothe taste
- More books, music, movie, but not occupied
- Listen the english episode without script
- have a website run on github, but totally know what's going on
- better programming skill, better work
