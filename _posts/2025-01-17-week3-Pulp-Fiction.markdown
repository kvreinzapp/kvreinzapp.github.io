- Don't you hate that? 
- Hate what?
- Uncomfortable silences
- Why do we feel it's necessary to yark about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
- I dont' know, but it's a good question
- That's when you know you've found somebody really special. when you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortablely share a silence.

A good movie, I like the silence part and the music, the golden watch part is pretty fun, could not predict that. The bibe thing and the miricle part is old.
good music by the way
