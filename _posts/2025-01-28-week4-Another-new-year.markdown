Don't gain love by push it away.
i realize that things happens so common in relationship, people try to push away, to hurt people to improve they love themselves, butthat just not works.
Things goes really fast this half year, escpecially since the September. That song seems appear everwhere, 3 movies use it.
Last year, i bought myself switch, i face the fire and hope good luck for me
i am crazy about the plan, but nothing goes acorrding to it, escpecially the big thing. Never thought i went to that city, never thought we could be departed.
i am crazy about the comment about me.
I don't think i am stable, just too tired and can no raise my emotions.
New year still have goals, and do not know i could achieve it or not.
Maybe the life's meaning is just get moments, all the other things could be pointless.
