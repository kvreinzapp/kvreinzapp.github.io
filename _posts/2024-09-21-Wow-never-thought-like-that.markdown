A good way to begin is to keep the following thought
in mind: “I know I have limitations and can easily be mistaken. And surely
I’ll never find all the answers I’d like to. But I can observe a little more
accurately, weigh things a little more thoroughly, and make up my mind a
little more carefully. If I do so, I’ll be a little closer to the truth.”
