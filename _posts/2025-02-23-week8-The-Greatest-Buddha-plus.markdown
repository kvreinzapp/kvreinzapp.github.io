Buddha or puta?
The skills director using is good, it shows a lot things without saying it out aloud. Just few scences and people understand it.
Like the car logo is twisted, he asked all the question about his hair and mother.
Well, rich man is evil, poor man is evil too, everyone have dark side.
I think this moive is about satire the rich and power, but i do not feel anything, cause that people do that things all the time.

Well the reason why i watch this movie is i wonder whether everyone is a island. I think people won't be honest, but totally isolate is not true.
