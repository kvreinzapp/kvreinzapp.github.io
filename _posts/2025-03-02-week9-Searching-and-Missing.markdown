This week, got 1 offer and 1 interview, good news, ready for working till i dead....
whatever, still not stop the steps to books and movies.
Want to read that wolf again, the translation really matters.
2 movies this week, the first one searching is great. I never see that way before, and it is really atractive. But i don't think it is deep enough. Still could see the liers and the problems never could be solved. And the second one missing is boring, far worse than the previous one.
Also read a book 炖马靴 written by  迟子建. I love her book before but now, could not have fun in it.
This week barely study or code anything, i should do better next week.
